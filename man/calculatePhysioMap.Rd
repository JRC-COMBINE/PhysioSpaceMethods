\title{Mapping new data into a physiological-space}
\usage{
calculatePhysioMap(InputData, Space, GenesRatio = 0.05, PARALLEL = FALSE,
  NumbrOfCores = NA, TTEST = FALSE, STATICResponse = F,
  ImputationMethod = "PCA")
}
\arguments{
\item{InputData}{A matrix of input gene expressions to be analyzed, with genes as rows and samples as columns. Corresponding Entrez Gene
IDs must be assigned to 'rownames' of the matrix, and name of each sample/column should be written in 'colnames'. REMEMBER that the gene
expressions in 'InputData' should be relative; e.g. fold change or signed p value of a statistical test.}

\item{Space}{The space in which the 'InputData' will be mapped. Just as 'InputData',
it should be a matrix with genes as rows and samples as columns, with corresponding Entrez Gene
IDs in 'rownames' of the matrix, and name of each axis of the space written in 'colnames'.}

\item{GenesRatio}{The ratio of gene expression values to be considered in the calculation. In the calculations only the highest and lowest
GenesRatio*100 percent of values in each sample are used, since signal to noise ratio in gene expression values
has a direct relation to the relative magnitute of expressions and out noisy inputs need to be filtered out.
GenesRatio should be a numerical value between 0 and 1. Default value is 0.05.}

\item{PARALLEL}{Logical value indicating if calculations should be done in parallel. Default value is FALSE.}

\item{NumbrOfCores}{Number of cores to be used when 'PARALLEL' is TRUE. Default is NA which will result in the program using
'all available cores - 1'.}

\item{TTEST}{Logical value indicating if t.test should be done in place of the default wilcoxon rank-sum test (more info can be found
in the original PhysioSpace: Lenz et. al., PLOS One 2013). Using t.test will speed up calculations. Default value is FALSE.}

\item{STATICResponse}{Logical value indicating if 'statistic' should be returned rather than the default 'signed p value'.
Default value is FALSE.}

\item{ImputationMethod}{Imputation method to use in case of missing values.}
}
\value{
Matrix of mapped 'InputData' values in 'Space', with rows corrisponding to axises of 'Space' and columns representing
samples in 'InputData'. Mapped values are signed p value when STATICResponse==FALSE, and are 'statistic' value when
STATICResponse==TRUE (more info can be found in the original PhysioSpace: Lenz et. al., PLOS One 2013).

Description: This package uses 'Big Data' to make robust 'Physiological Vectors' 
    in N dimensions space, within which it is possible to map new unknown data. 
    The calculation pipeline is a robust statistical method for relating high 
    dimensional omics data sets from heterogeneous sources using shared 
    physiological processes. It is designed to take advantage of the vast 
    availability of public omics data, which in combination with statistical 
    approaches makes a potent tool capable of analyzing heterogeneous 
    biological data sets. 'calculatePhysioMap' is the main analytical function 
    of the package. It uses a nonlinear mapping function to relate the unknown 
    input data with a physiological space. Physiological spaces are 
    mathematical spaces build upon known physiological data, and built using 
    the 'spaceMaker' function.
